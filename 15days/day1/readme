FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Popular:
Speed: Extremely fast â€” comparable to Node.js and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic under the hood).

Type Hints: Uses Python type hints for automatic validation, serialization, and editor support.

Auto Docs: Instantly generates interactive API docs (Swagger & ReDoc).

Async Support: Built-in support for asynchronous code using async/await.

Developer Friendly: Less boilerplate, more productivity, and excellent editor support (e.g., autocompletion, type checks).

Standards-based: Follows OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards.

âœ… Ideal For:
Building RESTful APIs

Microservices

ML model deployment backends

High-performance async applications

In short: FastAPI is fast, easy to use, and powerful â€” making it a top choice for modern Python API development.
